            <h1 style="text-align: center;">C++ Access Specifiers – Private, Public and Protected</h1>
            <p>C++ access specifiers are used for determining or setting the boundary for the availability of class
                members (data members and member functions) beyond that class.</p>
            <p>
                For example, the class members are grouped into sections, private protected and public. These keywords
                are called access specifiers which define the accessibility or visibility level of class members.

            </p>
            <p> By default the class members are private. So if the visibility labels are missing then by default all
                the class members are private.</p>
            <p>
                In inheritance, it is important to know when a member function in the base class can be used by the
                objects of the derived class. This is called accessibility and the access specifiers are used to
                determine this.
            </p>
            <h3>C++ Access Specifiers</h3>
            <p> Access specifier can be either private or protected or public. In general access specifiers are the
                access restriction imposed during the derivation of different subclasses from the base class.
            </p>

            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>public - members are accessible from outside the class</li>
                <li>private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class</li>
                <li>protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in
                    inherited classes. You will learn more about Inheritance later.</li>
            </ul>

            </p>

            <div data-pym-src="https://www.jdoodle.com/embed/v0/28Di"></div>
            <p>If you try to access a private member, an error occurs.</p>

            <p>
                <b>Note:
                </b>
                It is possible to access private members of a class using a public method inside the same class.
                See the next chapter (Encapsulation) on how to do this.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Tip:
                </b>
                It is considered good practice to declare your class attributes as private (as often as you can).
                This will reduce the possibility of yourself (or others) to mess up the code. This is also the main
                ingredient of the Encapsulation concept, which you will learn more about in the next chapter.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Public:</b>
                    All the class members declared under public will be available to everyone. The data members and
                    member functions declared public can be accessed by other classes too. The public members of a class
                    can
                    be accessed from anywhere in the program using the direct member access operator (.) with the object
                    of
                    that class.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Private:</b>
                    The class members declared as private can be accessed only by the functions inside the
                    class. They are not allowed to be accessed directly by any object or function outside the class.
                    Only the member functions or the friend functions are allowed to access the private data members of
                    a class.</li>

                <div data-pym-src="https://www.jdoodle.com/embed/v0/28Dq"></div>
                <li>
                    <b>Protected:</b>
                    Protected access modifier is similar to that of private access modifiers, the difference
                    is that the class member declared as Protected are inaccessible outside the class but they can be
                    accessed by any subclass(derived class) of that class. We will learn about protected access
                    specifier in later module.
