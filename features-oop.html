            <h3>Encapsulation</h3>

            Encapsulation is placing the data and the functions that work on that data in the same place. While
            working with procedural languages, it is not always clear which functions work on which variables but
            object-oriented programming provides you framework to place the data and the relevant functions together
            in the same object.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider a real-life example of encapsulation, in a company, there are different sections like the
                accounts section, finance section, sales section etc. The finance section handles all the financial
                transactions and keeps records of all the data related to finance. Similarly, the sales section handles
                all the sales-related activities and keeps records of all the sales. Now there may arise a situation
                when for some reason an official from the finance section needs all the data about sales in a particular
                month. In this case, he is not allowed to directly access the data of the sales section. He will first
                have to contact some other officer in the sales section and then request him to give the particular
                data. This is what encapsulation is. Here the data of the sales section and the employees that can
                manipulate them are wrapped under a single name “sales section”.
            </p>

            <p>
            <h3>Abstraction</h3>

            Data abstraction refers to, providing only essential information to the outside world and hiding their
            background details, i.e., to represent the needed information in program without presenting the details.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider a real-life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerators
                will increase the speed of the car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not know about how
                on pressing accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of
                the car or the implementation of accelerator, brakes etc in the car.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Polymorphism</h3>

            The ability to use an operator or function in different ways in other words giving different meaning or
            functions to the operators or functions is called polymorphism. Poly refers to many. That is a single
            function or an operator functioning in many ways different upon the usage is called polymorphism.
            </p>
            <p>
                In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one
                form.</p>
            <p>
                A person at the same time can have different characteristic. Like a man at the same time is a father, a
                husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behaviour in different situations. This is
                called polymorphism.
            </p>
            <p>
                An operation may exhibit different behaviours in different instances. The behaviour depends upon the
                types of data used in the operation.
            </p>

            <p>
                C++ supports operator overloading and function overloading.</p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>Operator Overloading:</i> The process of making an operator to exhibit different behaviours in
                    different instances is known as operator overloading.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Function Overloading:</i> Function overloading is using a single function name to perform
                    different types of tasks.
                </li>
            </ul>

            Polymorphism is extensively used in implementing inheritance.

            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Example:</b> Suppose we have to write a function to add some integers, some times there are 2
                integers, some times there are 3 integers. We can write the Addition Method with the same name having
                different parameters, the concerned method will be called according to parameters.
            </p>

            <p>
            <h3>Inheritance</h3>
            The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance.
            Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming.<br>

            Considering <i style="color:blueviolet">HumanBeing</i> a class, which has properties like hands, legs, eyes
            etc,
            and functions like
            walk, talk, eat, see etc. <i style="color:blueviolet">Male</i> and <i style="color:blueviolet">Female</i>
            are also classes, but most of the properties and
            functions are
            included in HumanBeing, hence they can inherit everything from class <i
                style="color:blueviolet">HumanBeing</i> using the concept of
            Inheritance.
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Sub Class:</b> The class that inherits properties from another class is called Sub class or
                    Derived
                    Class.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Super Class:</b> The class whose properties are inherited by sub class is called Base Class or
                    Super
                    class.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Implementing inheritance in C++: For creating a sub-class which is inherited from the base class we have
                to follow the below syntax.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Syntax:</b>
                <br>
            <section id="programs">
                class subclass_name : access_mode base_class_name
                <br>{
                <br>//body of subclass
                <br>};
            </section>


            Here, <b>subclass_name</b> is the name of the sub class, <b>access_mode</b> is the mode in which you want to
            inherit
            this sub class for example: public, private etc. and <b>base_class_name</b> is the name of the base class
            from
            which you want to inherit the sub class.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> A derived class doesn’t inherit access to private data members. However, it does inherit a
                full
                parent object, which contains any private members which that class declares.
            </p>


            <div data-pym-src="https://www.jdoodle.com/embed/v0/28Eh"></div>
            <p>
                In the above program the ‘Child’ class is publicly inherited from the ‘Parent’ class so the public data
                members of the class ‘Parent’ will also be inherited by the class ‘Child’.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h4>Modes of Inheritance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Public mode: If we derive a sub class from a public base class. Then the public member of the base
                    class
                    will become public in the derived class and protected members of the base class will become
                    protected in
                    derived class.</li>
                <li>Protected mode: If we derive a sub class from a Protected base class. Then both public member and
                    protected members of the base class will become protected in derived class.</li>
                <li>Private mode: If we derive a sub class from a Private base class. Then both public member and
                    protected
                    members of the base class will become Private in derived class.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

                    one sub class is inherited by one base class only.

                    <b>Hierarchical Inheritance:</b> In this type of inheritance, more than one sub class is inherited
                    from a
                    single base class. i.e. more than one derived class is created from a single base class.

                    <b>Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance:</b> Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by combining more than one
                    type of
                    inheritance. For example: Combining Hierarchical inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.
                    Below image shows the combination of hierarchical and multiple inheritance:
